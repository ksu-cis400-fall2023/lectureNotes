General announcements:
- NO late work accepted after Friday, December 1 (includes milestones and tutorials)
- Milestone 11 must be checked off in class or office hours (not Canvas)
- Week 15 will have one more tutorial plus a review for the final exam
- I'll post information about the website competition soon



Tutorial 1: POST requests and JSON (due today)
    - use POST requests for more security, to send more info, 
        when changing underlying data
    - can use JSON to simulate an external database
    - deserialize from JSON into objects when your application starts
    - serialize objects to JSON when a change is made
    - (in practice, you would use an external database for a web application)

Tutorial 2: Cloud workspaces (due Tuesday)
    - create Gitpod.io account
        (really useful for group projects and to be able to work from 
        multiple locations)
    - link to movie databases repo
    - with a few changes in settings, can launch app from Gitpod
    - (while running, will be publicly available)


Milestone 11 (due Friday, December 11)
    - Add a reviews link to your website
    - Should load previous reviews (sorted with newest on top)
    - User can add new reviews
    - All reviews are stored in JSON
    - Host pizza parlor repo on Gitpod.io
    - To "submit": demo in class or office hours
        - show launching your web app from Gitpod
        - show adding a couple of reviews (with newest on top)
        - show closing web app, launching again - reviews should still be there

For reviews:
- Create a data class for each review (string Text, DateTime PlacedAt)
- Create static ReviewDatabase class to load/add reviews
- Deserialize JSON to a List of those reviews
- When displaying reviews, will want to use OrderByDescending on the PlacedAt
    property

    see: https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/3-web-development/05-linq/04-linq-syntax/index.html

--> you can have a Reviews property in your PageModel that gets the result
    of a LINQ query that orders the ReviewDatabase reviews by PlacedAt
