Milestone 11 (due Friday, December 11)
    - Add a reviews link to your website
    - Should load previous reviews (sorted with newest on top)
    - User can add new reviews
    - All reviews are stored in JSON
    - Host pizza parlor repo on Gitpod.io
    - To "submit": demo in class or office hours
        - show launching your web app from Gitpod
        - show adding a couple of reviews (with newest on top)
        - show closing web app, launching again - reviews should still be there

For reviews:
- Create a data class for each review (string Text, DateTime PlacedAt)
- Create static ReviewDatabase class to load/add reviews
- Deserialize JSON to a List of those reviews
- When displaying reviews, will want to use OrderByDescending on the PlacedAt
    property

    see: https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/3-web-development/05-linq/04-linq-syntax/index.html

--> you can have a Reviews property in your PageModel that gets the result
    of a LINQ query that orders the ReviewDatabase reviews by PlacedAt
