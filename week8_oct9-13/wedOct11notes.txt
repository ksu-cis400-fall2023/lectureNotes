Milestone 6, due Friday:

    - Make Order implement INotifyCollectionChanged (why?)
        ** error in data binding tutorial -
            Remove should remove item, invoke event when 
            index > -1 (when the item is really there), NOT when index == -1

    - Make Order implement INotifyPropertyChanged
        - which properties do we care about?
            Subtotal, Total, Tax, TaxRate

        - when do they change?
            Subtotal, Total, Tax all change when add/remove/clear
            TaxRate has a set - would impact Tax, Total, TaxRate

        - what about individual menu items?
    
    --> what should the finished milestone look like?

    --> give a tax rate (9.15%)
    --> Date: can either show as just the date or (preferably) the date and time

    Can do something like this to format Text:
        Text="{Binding Path=PlacedAt, StringFormat='Date: {0}'}"

    Similarly for a price:
        Text="{Binding Path=Subtotal, StringFormat='Subtotal: {0:C}'}"

    - also, update UML (show that you are implementing those interfaces)
        --> show the DataContext as an association 

    - you don't have to test the CollectionChanged event

    - done early? implement INotifyPropertyChanged for each menu item

    - testing Order Number
