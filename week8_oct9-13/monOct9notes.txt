This week: data binding

What is it?

Tutorial: data binding 1 (due today)

    --> involves implementing INotifyCollectionChanged on ShoppingListItems
        why?
        what is the process?

Tutorial: data binding 2 (due tomorrow)

    --> involves implementing INotifyPropertyChanged on ShoppingListItems
        AND LineItem

        why?
        what is the process?


--> In general, when to implement INotifyCollectionChanged?
    -> when to invoke the CollectionChanged event?

--> When to implement INotifyPropertyChanged?
    -> when to invoke the PropertyChanged event?


Milestone 6, due Friday:
    - What was our old DataContext?
    - What would make more sense as our DataContext?
        --> what does that mean we need to do?
    


    - Make Order implement INotifyCollectionChanged (why?)
    - Make Order implement INotifyPropertyChanged
        - which properties do we care about?
        - when do they change?
        - what about individual menu items?
    
    --> what should the finished milestone look like?

    - also, update UML (show that you are implementing those interfaces)
        --> show the DataContext as an association 

    - make sure PropertyChanged event is invoked as necessary
        --> including the times that changing a property changes a DERIVED property

    - you don't have to test the CollectionChanged event
