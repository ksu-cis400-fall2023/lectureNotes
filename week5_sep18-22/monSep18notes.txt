    - IMenuItem (change Soda, IcedTea to have CaloriesPerEach, CaloriesTotal)
    - Topping enum/PizzaTopping class
    - General Pizza class implements IMenuItem
        - List of possible PizzaToppings

        - Don't need calories properties any more
        - Override as needed
    - Drink, Side are abstract, implement IMenuItem
        - Collect together shared info from drinks and sides
        - Make all drinks extend Drink, all side extend Side
    - Order class implements ICollection<IMenuItem>
        - Allows you to add items to an Order
        - Calculates subtotal, tax, total
    - Create UML diagram
    - Update old tests for changes, add Pizza and Order tests

--> you will probably want a way to get/check/update pizza toppings
--> UML can get messy - divide into sections, repeating if necessary
