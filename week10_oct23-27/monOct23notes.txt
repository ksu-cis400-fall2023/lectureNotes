Monday: MVVM tutorial
    Purpose of MVVM?


Tuesday: Programmatic controls tutorial

Exam 2: Wed Nov 1

///////////////////////

Milestone 8: due Fri Oct 27
- last WPF milestone (will start Razor pages after Exam 2)
- allow pizza topping customizations (do we need more than one pizza control now?)
    --> how to show the correct topping options for a pizza? 
    --> where do we need to invoke PropertyChanged?  from PizzaTopping
    --> how to make sure that a change in topping affects the pizza?
        for all pizza toppings, attach an event handler

    in Pizza constructor, attach event handler to all the PizzaToppings

- implement cancel order button (what should the new DataContext be?)
    could make DataContext be a new order
    or, Clear the Order 

- implement complete order button


Payment screen (has a corresponding ViewModel, will be its DataContext):
- lists order cost (subtotal, tax, total)
- allows input for amount paid (defaults to total, can't go below total)
- uses data binding to display change (will update as the amount paid is modified)
- print receipt 


Recommendations:
- do pizza customizations first
- then do cancel order button
- then write ViewModel for payment screen (what will it need to implement?)
- then design payment screen with data binding to the ViewModel
- then finish complete order process
