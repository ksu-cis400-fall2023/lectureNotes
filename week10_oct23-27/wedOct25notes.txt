Quick question: what is your experience with HTML and CSS?

///////////////////////

Milestone 8: due Fri Oct 27
- last WPF milestone (will start Razor pages after Exam 2)
- allow pizza topping customizations (still just one pizza control)
- add mechanic to remove an item from the order
- implement cancel order button 

- implement complete order button

Payment screen (has a corresponding ViewModel, will be its DataContext):
- lists order cost (subtotal, tax, total)
- allows input for amount paid (defaults to total, can't go below total)
- uses data binding to display change (will update as the amount paid is modified)
- print receipt 


--> behavior if removing an item while payment screen is showing


Testing?
- changing a PizzaTopping should invoke a change in several Pizza properties

UML?
- show PizzaTopping implements INotifyPropertyChanged
- Add payment control and view model, plus necessary associations
