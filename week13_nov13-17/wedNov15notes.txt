MS 10: due Friday

- add filters by keyword, calories, price
- testing
    - check null values
    - what are some special case numerical values?
        min/max are the same
        min is bigger than the max
        biggest possible uint
    - make sure each filter returns expected results
        might hardcode a small menu to search
        apply filter
        see if the items you expect are in the result

        try to cover cases like: one search term, multiple search terms,
            mix the order of search terms, mixed case
