Tutorial 1 (due today)
- filter movie DB by name, MPAA rating, Genre, IMDB/Rotten Tomatoes ratings
- first part is recorded, follow linked instructions to complete remaining filters
- takes a little longer, but is really similar to the milestone

--> can bind an HTML input to a property in the PageModel
--> or, can update OnGet to take parameters whose names/types match the 
    form input elements


Tutorial 2 (due Tuesday)
- update filters to be LINQ queries


//suppose items is an IEnumerable<SomeType
IEnumerable<SomeType> keep = items.Where(item => (some condition about item));


Or could write:
IEnumerable<SomeType> keep = from item in items 
                        where (some condition about item)
                        select item;
