Milestone 7: due Friday, October 20
- create controls for customizing menu items
- for each menu item, be able to customize all aspects
- exception: don't need to customize pizza toppings yet

- customization should open when you click a menu item

- should be a way to edit other items in the order

--> use a custom event to go from a button click in the menu to the
    customization screen


--> see example


Custom event steps in MS7:
1) Make a custom event args class that extends RoutedEventArgs. It should
    contain the info needed about the event. (What is needed? IMenuItem)

2) Declare an event with your custom args in the class where the action will happen
    (where is this? in the menu selection code-behind)

3) Invoke your event (with the info in a new custom args) when the action happens
    (when would this be? How to get the info? menu selection's click event
    create the custom args from the menu item you're already creating there)

4) In the class where you want to make something happen, write an event handler 
    method that takes a sender and a custom args. Do whatever is needed.
    (where should the event handler be? what should it do?)
    Main window. want: figure out which customization control (look at
    the menu item). Whichever it is, make it visible and make the menu selection
    hidden. Set the DataContext of the customization control to be the menu item.

5) In the same class as #4, attach your event handler to the event in #2
    (where to do this?)
    add the event handler in the main window constructor

--> testing: test PropertyChanged for all menu items
