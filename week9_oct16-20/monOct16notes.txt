Today: custom events and switching displays
Tuesday: custom controls and displaying enums


Milestone 7: due Friday, October 20
- create controls for customizing menu items
- for each menu item, be able to customize all aspects
- exception: don't need to customize pizza toppings yet
- how many pizza controls? just need one

- use custom count control (like tutorial)
- load enum values as resources

--> show sample customization control

- customization control should appear after you click to order an item
- need a way to pick an item in the order and edit it again
- need to program Back to Menu button

--> recommend placing all customization controls on the main window in the same 
    location as the menu selection control. Set visibility to hidden.

--> on button click, what should happen? How to pass information? 

    make menu control have an event

    in main window, you can attach an event handler to that event

    in menu control click event, do something like:
        MyCustomEvent?.Invoke(....)
        make your custom event args contain that new menu item object

        main window event handler will know which customization control 
        to display

        set DataContext of that customization control to that menu item


--> possible issue: Count property name (rename to SideCount)


--> recommended order of approach:
    pick Wings 
    get it totally working first
