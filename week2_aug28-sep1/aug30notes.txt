Encapsulation and Properties tutorials should be done
    (can still complete for the late penalty)

Milestone 1 due Friday

Making 6 new data classes for menu items
    (are we repeating a lot of code?)





See starter SupremePizza class
    - different ways of declaring properties
    - different way of creating object (in SpecialInstructions)

Count property - enforcing an upper bound
    will want a private backing field

    private uint _count;


--> documentation is not required for MS 1 (but will be for MS 2)

--> before submitting, double-check:
    - that you have all the new classes
    - that you have the correct properties in each class
    - that your spelling/capitalization of classes, properties,
        and string literals matches the writeup
    - that you are bounding each Count property
    - that each relevant item has the correct starting count
