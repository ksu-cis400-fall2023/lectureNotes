- Milestone 5:
    - Write shell of GUI for the "point of sale" for the Pizza Parlor
    - Clicking menu items should add them to the order display

Look at sample GUI picture.
    - do you have to match it exactly?
    - what kind of layout for the menu?
    - what kind of layout for the order?

Review: what is DataContext? How does it work?

Order control should contain a ListView
    - what should our DataContext be?
    - where should we set it?


--> some functionality will be missing for now.
    - Order subtotal/total/tax being correctly displayed
    - Being able to edit menu items
    - Displaying more information about items than just the name
    - Back to Menu / Cancel Order / Complete Order buttons


Common questions:
- How to add lines around different controls and layouts?
- How to add project references?
- Using height/width
- What to have for the number, date, total, subtotal, tax
- What to include on the UML for PointOfSale?
    (how to add namespaces to PointOfSale?)
